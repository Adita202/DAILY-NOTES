- pass - to fill in the code later to- avoid error

### Iteration in python

- ***While loop***
- ***For loop***

**_While condition_**
	#statement

**_To Know total keywords_**
import keyword
**print(keyword.kwlist)**

 - To continue a long list, if we need to enter the rest in the next like use \ symbol
  - Multiple assignments can be written on a single line using **,
**eg**: x,y,z = [3,4], [5,6], [2,1]

### **STANDARD INPUT**
*name = input("Enter your name: ")*
name = input("Enter your name :")
print("Welcome to ICT,", name, "Good to have you here")


### **Functions**
* Built in functions
* custom functions

###### Doc string
This fn is added to nums as a documentation
'''Depicted in triple quotes '''


These are some of the keywords and iterations.


***Some simple jupyter works***

fruits = ["apple", 70, "mango", 30]
fruits.append(30)
print(fruits)


fruits.append("grapes")  - here append used to add new item
print(fruits)


range = (0,5)
stop = 5
list(range)    - here, 0 represents ***start***
               - here, 5 represents ***stop***
	       - a third number for say (0,5,1) - here 1 is ***skip***
