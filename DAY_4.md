### DAY 4 - Introduction to NUMPY and PANDAS

##### **Numpy**
- NumPy (Numerical Python) is a powerful open-source library in Python used for numerical computations.
- It provides support for multi-dimensional arrays, mathematical functions, and tools for working with large datasets 
     making it a foundation for scientific computing and data analysis in Python.

***How to Instal***
- Open jupyter notebook(or any preferred platform)
- import numpy as np

  There are many keywords and shortcuts in numpy. Easier to find operations like mean, median, mode, standard deviation, variance etc.


 ##### **Pandas**
 - Pandas is a powerful, open-source Python library used for data manipulation and analysis.
 - It is built on top of the NumPy library and provides flexible and easy-to-use data structures for
    working with structured data like tables, time series, and more.

***How to instal***
-open jupyter notebook
-import pandas as pd
**we get output as tables**
