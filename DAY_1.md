### DAY 1
##### Introduction to python environment

**_Pycharm_**
- Specifically for python dev
- Libraries mostly are by default stored
*Pycharm professional -paid version
Git repository-avoid conflicts-multiple people single project-avail updated version

**_Jupyter notebook, google collab_**
More structured
Venv- virtual env – to reduce conflict between diff versions of lib or pythons of a project

**_Jupyter Notebook_**
Beginner friendly-separate cell by cell execution-visual can be obtained on the same file, (others appear as a pop up window- pycharm, VSC)

- suppress a particular command – will not execute that, for that we can use #
- Combine code, text and visualization
- Lack features – debugging, project management- online only, cannot be used offline
- Two cells available – code cell (for executing codes)- either use play button or shift +enter
                                     Markdown cell type (to write texts – without using # symbol)
+to add cell
- Scissor symbol- remove cell
 ***Google collab***
.ipynb or .py

**_Spyder_**
More visualization 

###### Introduction - Anaconda

- Set of packages arranged

**_python notebook_**
- code cell - for writing codes
- markdown cell for writing general infos- this wont be executed, we can also add pictures in markdown.
- print shift+tab - referece
- shortcut keys & markdown refereces - useful to know while coding
-study
- kernel option - to interrupt the process if there is any problems

This is a general introduction of python environment.
