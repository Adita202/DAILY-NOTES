#### Day - 5 - Databases

 ##### **SQL-Structural Query Language**

* make life easier, simpler and faster
* arranged in a specific order for easy finding
* common databases - sql (structured query language)
* instructions given as similar as humans but they are interpreted in the programming language at the back end
* done without much programming background instead uses query language
* so imp to know any one query language
* eg of db : Oracle, SQL, My SQL
* 1970s from IBM
* 4 operations take place - CRUD - create, read, update, delete


#### *RELATIONAL AND NON RELATIONAL DB
*RELATIONAL DB: Structured-clear rltn btw points datapoints
*Non relational - offers more flexible by storing data in various formats like docs, key- value pairs , allowing for less structured more dynamic datasets.eg: MongoBD


RDB ideal for highly structured data with complex queries.
NRDB large volumes of diverse data with rapid scalability needs

in rdb, all data stored across multiple tables. it avoids data duplication. (spiderman movie eg)
there is a primary key associated with each tables.(they are unique).

table 1  movie id, movie name, year -  primary key is movie id
table 2 actor id, actor name, gender - primary key is actor id
table 3 movie id, actor id

sql is not a general purpose programming language, it is a domain specific language (db)
General purpose of PL  - create web/ mobile apps, games, DBs, Operating System etc
eg: c/c++, python - procedural programming language-step by step info provided
SQL is a declarative PL

Execution of SQL
 sql - parser - complier - executer

*parser: tries to understand query
*complier: query optimizer and generates code
*executer - results*


SQL KEY WORDS 
* SELECT
* FROM
* LIMIT - to end within that limit
* WHERE
* OFFSET -to skip the particular limit and show
* ORDER BY - (by default asc order, if you wanna change to desc-give desc)
* SELECT DISTINCT - to find distinct data
* IS NULL
* IS NOT NULL
###### Logical Operations - comes along WHERE clause

* AND
* OR
* NOT
* ANY
* BETWEEN
* EXIST
* IN
* LIKE
* SOME

Further, we could practice and check the level of our proficiency in SQL using websites like SQLZoo, Hackerrank etc.
